# 🏡 Airbnb Business Intelligence Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data to gain insights into the tactical and operational aspects of the business. Through Tableau dashboards and regression analysis, the project seeks to uncover key trends and provide recommendations to improve Airbnb's business operations.

### Challenges
Airbnb faces several data management issues, such as insufficient datasets, inconsistent data sources, and manual processing. This lack of a cohesive data architecture leads to inefficiency, complicates finding underperforming areas, and hinders the creation of meaningful analyses. Moreover, the lack of a consolidated data repository restricts the company's ability to scale and adapt to changing market demands.

### Project Objectives
To overcome these challenges, this project aims to create a comprehensive business intelligence system that will enable Airbnb to use data to drive growth, streamline operations, and enhance customer satisfaction in New York City. The primary goals are:

- **Improving data-driven decision-making**: Develop a single source of truth for data, establishing a robust business intelligence platform for easier analysis and visualization.
- **Enhancing operational efficiency**: Identify inefficient areas and automate manual tasks to reduce costs and improve productivity.
- **Boosting customer satisfaction**: Personalize user experiences, streamline guest feedback and optimize the booking process to increase satisfaction.
