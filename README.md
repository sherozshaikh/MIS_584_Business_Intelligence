WPI MIS 584 Business Intelligence

## Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing Airbnb data to gain insights into tactical and operational aspects of the business. The analysis involves the creation of Tableau dashboards and regression analysis to extract key information and trends.

## Project Overview
Due to Airbnb's insufficient data management architecture, there are insufficient data sets, inconsistent data sources, and manual processing. This makes it more difficult to find inefficient regions and automate manual procedures, in addition to impeding the ability to produce insightful analyses. Furthermore, the company's capacity to grow and adapt to shifting market demands is hampered by the absence of a consolidated data repository and defined procedures.

To overcome these obstacles, the goal of this project is to create and put into place a complete business intelligence system that will allow Airbnb to use data to propel growth, streamline operations, and surpass consumer expectations in New York City. The following are the project's main goals:
  - By developing a single source of truth for data and putting in place a business intelligence platform to make data analysis and visualization easier, to improve data-driven decision-making.
  - Reduce costs and increase productivity by finding inefficient areas in the business and automating manual tasks.
  - Use data to personalize user experiences, expedite guest feedback, and enhance the booking process as a whole to increase customer happiness.

## Dashboards
The project includes two Tableau dashboards, each providing unique insights into Airbnb data.

### Tactical Dashboard
This dashboard offers a high-level view of key metrics, including booking trends, popular locations, and revenue generation. It is designed to provide strategic insights to guide business decisions.

- **Features**:
  - Booking trends over time
  - Top locations by booking volume
  - Revenue analysis by property type

### Operational Dashboard
This dashboard focuses on operational metrics that are essential for managing day-to-day business operations. It includes data on occupancy rates, customer reviews, and property management.

- **Features**:
  - Occupancy rates by location
  - Customer review analysis
  - Maintenance and property management metrics

## Regression Analysis
The regression analysis component of this project aims to identify factors that impact booking rates and revenue. It uses statistical methods to analyze relationships between different variables and generate predictive insights.

- **Tools Used**:
  - Tableau for visualization
  - Python for regression analysis
    - ML Models
    - **Linear Model**: Assess linearity and simplicity. Offers interpretable coefficients, aiding understanding.
    - **Decision Tree**: Capture non-linearity effectively. Provide intuitive decision-making insights. Robust to outliers and mixed data types.
    - **Naive Bayes**: Employ probabilistic modeling efficiently. Simple and interpretable with reasonable assumptions.
  
- **Findings**:
  - Key predictors of booking rates
  - Factors affecting revenue growth
